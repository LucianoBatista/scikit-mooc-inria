# Material of the MOOC: _ML in Python with Scikit-Learn_

Here you'll find all the material offered by the MOOC:

- notebooks of each chapter
- slides with figures
- scripts used as helpers for data visualization
- datasets used as examples during the MOOC

## Environment

You can find all the libraries that I used during the MOOC under the Pipefile file. And if you use Pipenv to manage your packages, just run:

- `pipenv install`

And the whole environment will be ready to code.
